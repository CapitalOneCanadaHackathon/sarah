### 5 MINUTE DEMO - PRESENTATION

----------------------
#### Challenge #3 : Looking to reach a younger donor demographic by leveraging technology such mobile giving platform.
Currently, the Women’s Habitat uses on-line donation via website and general solicitation on social media. We would like to explore the use of QR Codes & Tags, text to give and options to host a giving day. This solution can include recommendations for using free or low cost platforms.

#### Women’s Habitat provides a variety of services including:
+ Outreach services
+ Programs for women
+ Programs for youths
+ Drop-in programs
+ Emergency shelter

#### Two main issues/challenges:
+ Women’s Habitat statistic services:
+ crisis calls (for shelter and other – i.e. counselling, etc.): 1100
+ Attracting younger donors, implementing mobile donations
+ Millennials donate through their phone
+ Monthly donor / subscription / retention

#### Solution: Introducing S.A.R.A.H.
Survivors Automated Response Alert Hotline
(Give the judges business cards)

SARAH is not a registered dietitian. Discreet. Text messages are easy to be donated.
Please proceed to texting the number any questions that you think a survivor would ask.
(As they are texting SARAH, explain what SARAH does).

SARAH is a mobile 24/7 support companion-bot that also solicits donations. She provides easy conversation and information to services via text message. She also updates and check-ins/follow ups with survivors after they have left the shelter. Most importantly, SARAH is a mobile giving platform.



#### Judges - each judge focused on a specific criteria:

#### Problem Solver: Effectively addresses one of the challenges of the assigned charity.
+ We have created SARAH to directly address two main issues/challenges.
1. With SARAH, the younger donor demographic can donate via this mobile giving platform. SMS text, Facebook messenger, whichever medium the user feels comfortable.
+ (Demonstration): DONATE function via text.
+ Marketing campaign: STORY function and show social example promotion posts, explain the chapter a day.
+ 25days4her - subscription
+ Why this works: millennials appeal to emotional experiences, quick, very little effort, short read, emotional investment
+ Introduce mobile platform, connecting social media with donating
+ Increase younger donors by 2900+
+ Increase awareness facebook/twitter followers by 5000+
+ Increase donor retention: first time (20%) and repeat donor (50%) retention
+ This campaign is projected to produce an estimated total of $100,000 donations

2. With SARAH, increase current methods for promoting services - on a personal platform, include website, social media and word of mouth.


#### Impact: The solution will have an immediate and positive impact on the charity.
##### Immediate:
+ Increase following, donations, awareness,
+ Promoting services
+ Campaign easily implemented
##### Positive:
+ Donor retention
+ Long term: Forecasting stats - Donation summary
+ Immediately opens up to XXXX donors

##### User-Friendly: The solution can be implemented by the charity with minimal effort.
+ SARAH is user friendly to the client,
+ The charity will have a log-in

##### Performance: the solution works and functions as intended.
+ The application is implemented on the client and server side with real calls to the serverless backend hosted on AWS. The chat aspect of the application via api.ai makes it a very simple way for women to interact with Women's Habitat without compromising their safety. The admin client app shows relevant analytics in a simple way that permits Women's Habitat employees to make better decisions based on user interaction with SARAH.

##### Pitch Perfect: The pitch of the solution conveyed the problem, solution and feasibility.
+ Problem: They were not getting enough donations, and wanted to expand into the younger demographics. We identified the key opportunity is to also capture reoccuring donations from the same donor. [Insert stat]
+ Solution: We identified key behaviours and trends among the young demographics ie. millennials. Millenials are mobile-oriented and therefore, we utilized SMS messaging along with Facebook messaging to provide value upon donation.
+ Story: #25days4Her, create empathy, short story chapters, raise awareness and educate others, and subscription to further chapters and potential monthly donations
+ Mobile payments: Text or Facebook messenger to create a seamless payment method.
+ Feasibility: The entire cost of SARAH is $250/year. At a fixed donation of $5 per subscription period, it only requires 50 subscribers to breakeven. Because of the uniqueness, and shareability of the post and content, we see a consistent growth in following among the demographic. [Yr3: 11K]

##### Design: The design of the solution was well thought out.
+ Developers. Frontline/Backend. S.A.R.A.H.
+ Someone has to describe: sarah.com (From the admin standpoint, ESPECIALLY MANAGING DONATIONS VIA MOBILE)

##### Innovation: The team has identified a unique way to solve the problem.
+ Promoting Women’s Habitat services and providing companionship via S.A.R.A.H. to break the return cycle back to the shelter.
+ It’s innovative because it is easily accessible and private
+ Story campaign with mobile subscription & payment

##### Pushing Tech: The team uses new technology (software and/ or hardware) to solve the problem.
+ This uses currently existing technology in combination with bot-mobile.
